# JellyPhx
soft body physics simulation based on point-masses and springs

# How To Use
setup.cfg commands:                                                                                                
 w [resolution x] [resolution y]        # sets window size;                                                           
 g [gravity x] [gravity y]              # sets gravity;                                                              
 l [filename] [position x] [position y] # loads physics object from file;
